# Provides ability to package software (binaries, configuration files,
# etc.) into a set of self-installable well-compressed distribution files.
# They can be installed on a target system as sub-packages and removed or
# patched if necessary. The package repository is stored together with
# installed files, so non-root installs are possible. A set of tasks can
# be specified to perform pre/post install/remove actions. Package content
# description can be used from software build environment to implement
# installation rules for trying out the binaries directly on a development
# system, thus decoupling compilation and installation rules.
