  Provides ability to package software (binaries, configuration files,
  etc.) into a set of self-installable well-compressed distribution files.
  They can be installed on a target system as sub-packages and removed or
  patched if necessary. The package repository is stored together with
  installed files, so non-root installs are possible. A set of tasks can
  be specified to perform pre/post install/remove actions. Package content
  description can be used from software build environment to implement
  installation rules for trying out the binaries directly on a development
  system, thus decoupling compilation and installation rules.
